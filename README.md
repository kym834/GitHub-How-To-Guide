New to the Breaking Good Project and GitHub? 

You've come to the right place! This repository is your how-to guide for using GitHub. 

The Breaking Good Project uses GitHub as a tool to share, store and discuss information and ideas related to our projects. As our projects are open source GitHub is the perfect, allowing anyone and everyone to participate. 

You will first need to set up a GitHub account. To get started, head on over to the [wiki](https://github.com/kym834/GitHub-How-To-Guide/wiki) and navigate to 'setting up a GitHub account'.
