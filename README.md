# WELCOME!

New to the Breaking Good Project and GitHub? You've come to the right place! 

The Breaking Good Project uses GitHub as a tool to share, store and discuss ideas, information and data related to our projects. As our projects are open source, GitHub is perfect, allowing anyone and everyone to participate. This repository is your resource on how to use GitHub as part of your Breaking Good project.

You will first need to set up a GitHub account. To get started, head on over to the [wiki](https://github.com/kym834/GitHub-How-To-Guide/wiki) and navigate to 'setting up a GitHub account'.
